GALLBLADDER
Stagnation in the gallbladder will also lead to the formation of sand with the subsequent appearance of stones. 
Prevention: Periodically, you need to eat fried and spicy foods. If you do not like fried and spicy foods, you can replace them with periodic use of choleretic drugs on the recommendation of your doctor.

The most interesting organ to observe is the kidneys. This is a "silent organ" - it will show at least some symptoms and cause inconvenience to the carrier only when everything is very bad. First, sand can form there, then stones.
Prevention - you need to drink plenty of fluids. Ideally, water. Allowed - light beer or other FILTERED alcohol (for example, Germany has one of the lowest rates of kidney problems in the world due to high beer consumption)
