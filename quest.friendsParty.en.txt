The absence of a third person in your life leads to:
* depression
* mental health problems
* deterioration of social relationships and loss of social skills

If you do not have a third place, it is advisable to create one. You can explain this concept to your friends and explain why it is necessary and start a tradition of coming there no matter how your life changes. The birth of a child, a job change, etc. - nothing should be a reason to completely abandon the "third place".
