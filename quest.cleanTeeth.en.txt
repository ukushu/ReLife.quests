SELECTING A TOOTHBRUSH:
* You need a medium stiff toothbrush. Unless your doctor has prescribed a different one.
* Vibrating toothbrushes are not always a good option. Rotating brushes are better - but you need to know how to use them properly.
* The larger the bristle area, the better the toothbrush.
* The toothbrush is held in a cup with plenty of baking soda and water. The bristles are completely submerged. Rinse in running water before use.
* Brushes are purchased in bulk with a quantity reserve and are replaced as needed as they wear out (thanks to the baking soda and salt solution, they do not need to be replaced every 2 months)

OTHER:
* Toothpaste names are not just for marketing purposes. If a toothpaste says "antibacterial", it means that additional bactericidal ingredients are actually added. If a toothpaste says "Restore and Protect", it almost certainly contains enamel-restoring components. And so on.
* If your teeth feel really bad, you need to drink calcium citrate. To save money, you can buy food grade in chemical stores. Calcium carbonate can leave sand in the kidneys. But if you drink enough water and do not have calcium sand, there should be no problems with calcium carbonate. The amount is about 1000mg per person over 18. 1500mg - for people over 60. The course is 1 month. 
    [Do not use with vitamin D - you will get hypercalcemia with the specified amount. For use with vitamin D, consult your doctor]
* The more often you brush your teeth from tartar, the more tartar will build up. So the less you do, the better (within reason). And if you brush your teeth well as directed, you may not even need to.
