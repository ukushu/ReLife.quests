V.1.0
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that transmits pleasure and the emotional response of motivation in the brain. 
We are interested in the fact that it is responsible for your motivation to achieve something.

How to kill your dopamine system?
You need to get used to getting everything quickly for free and without effort.
Free dopamine can be of different types:
* sweets
* high-calorie foods
* foods containing artificially added monosodium glutamate
* alcohol
* drugs
* soft drugs (e.g. weed)
* porn
* fast loans
* online casinos
* financial and cryptocurrency exchanges
* visualization of how you have achieved some success (your brain does not see the difference between real and imaginary)
* constant watching of movies and TV series
* constant reading of fiction
* anything else that is considered entertainment content, anything that contains a component of excitement.

All this gives you free dopamine. And the more dopamine we consume in such an easy way, the harder it is to make efforts to achieve something real. This all leads to loss of motivation and depression.

This quest is dedicated to dopamine withdrawal by limiting the time spent on social media - tiktok, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, etc. - in order to save your dopamine for more useful things.
