Benefits of 8000 steps a day:
* Improved heart health
* Weight control. Walking is no less effective for weight loss than cardio exercises and weightlifting
* Improved mood - walking increases the production of endorphins
* Reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes - maintaining the correct blood glucose level
* Strengthening the muscles of the legs and pelvis
* Reducing stress and anxiety (mental health)
* Improving sleep

The results of a meta-analysis of 111,000 people show a direct correlation between the amount of movement and life expectancy. The lowest number of steps per day that is desirable is 2600-2800. This number of steps has the greatest impact on life expectancy. 

Increasing the number of steps has a logarithmic effectiveness graph that has almost no beneficial effect after 8000-10000 steps.

If you walk 8000-10000 steps every day, the likelihood of a longer life increases by almost 60%. No medicine can have such a strong impact on your health.
