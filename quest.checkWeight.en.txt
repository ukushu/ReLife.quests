If you are over 23 years old, you need to start watching your weight. 

...... There are many factors that affect your body in unexpected ways because you don't think about them.

While you are growing up, a huge amount of calories are spent directly on body growth, and many hormonal changes occur in the body. Also, at a young age, in kindergarten, school, university, you move a lot. Physical activity, games, physical education, etc. After graduating from university, your rhythm of life changes dramatically to a less mobile one. And your calorie intake remains the same, and at this point, a person can start to gain weight dramatically. And this happens to most people.

In addition, at the age of 24~ there is another transition period for the body (yes, there are many) and your body undergoes physiological and endocrine changes, and you can start gaining weight at any time because of these changes.

You should allow yourself to be overweight for the shortest possible time. The longer you stay "in the body," the more likely it is that your endocrine system will get used to this weight and start to accept it as your personal norm. If this happens, it will be more difficult to lose weight.

The body of overweight people ages faster. 
This is based on two verifiable scientific facts:
* The larger the body, the larger the skin area. The larger the skin area, the more cells are needed to form it. And skin is the main organ that visually shows aging.
* Cells can divide a limited number of times - about 50. The larger the skin area, the more cells are needed. [Proved in 1961 by Professor L. Hayflick].

This means that those people who are the thinnest will be the least susceptible to aging. But being very thin is not an option either, because many other health problems are associated with dystrophy. Accordingly, the lower limit of the "norm" is optimal. If it does not contradict your individual norm (!) and you do not have problems characteristic of lower-level dystrophies. For example, prolapse of internal organs due to insufficient intra-abdominal fat or something similar.

Being overweight means:
* Possibility of developing diabetes (even if you are overweight [not to mention first degree obese])
* Problems with the knees
* Increased likelihood of developing cancer
* Cardiovascular diseases. Including incurable ones
and many other serious problems. The whole list can be found at the link:

* These data indicate that rapid weight gain at an early age, followed by rapid weight loss, has a greater impact on life expectancy than body weight itself. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608894/
* Thin rats live longer than overweight rats https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9322565/

Other:
* 38% of the world's population is obese. This is despite the fact that most people with normal weight are young people


PS:
It is also important to understand the principle by which the chosen "medical norm" in the issue of "normal weight" is the average weight of a person. That is, if everyone in the world gains 10 kg, you will almost certainly become obese within the medical norm. 
Choose your weight based on your inner feelings of lightness - the medical norm is not something to be guided by.
