A post should not be about anything, but with a specific purpose and for a specific audience. It should be such that it could potentially be monetized. And, of course, it should be about an interesting topic.

To begin with, you should look for an interesting topic and identify your future audience.

You should also choose the way of monetization in advance. If you plan to simply maintain a page with information and earn money from advertising, this is one strategy. If you plan to make posts about selling a product or service, this is a completely different approach.

Post type:
* If it's a text post - once a day.
* If it's a video, you can post it 1-2 times a week, and devote the rest of the days, for example, to preparing and shooting the material.

Focus on your plans and needs and make the most of them!
Make a plan for promoting your social media page!
Think about your strategy!

The fact that you will be forced to constantly look for new interesting topics will help you develop:
* Communication skills (post - communication in the comments)
* Self-development (more knowledge and more practical experience in creating content, not in consuming it)
* In case of success - a bonus - an advertising platform where you can make money or business.
* Certain SMM skills, which is also likely to be useful
